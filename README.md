## Building AI Systems By Breaking and Learning

I’m someone who dives deep into how AI thinks, breaks things to see what happens, and builds systems that are stronger each time. Started this journey in May out of pure curiosity, and somehow ended up with production systems solving real problems – all while reworking my repos to be more secure, reliable, and future-proof.
## What I Actually Do

I explore AI’s behavior patterns and build multi-agent systems around those insights. My approach is simple: treat AI like an unpredictable collaborator, study its quirks, and architect infrastructure that turns unpredictability into usable, resilient workflows.
Stuff I’ve Been Breaking (and Building) Recently

    EphemeralAgentExecutor – Finally solved the zombie subprocess problem (after it broke everything multiple times).

    Mycelium Database – Distributed graph storage inspired by fungi networks’ resilience and healing.

    Shared Memory API – High-performance communication layer for real agent coordination.

    Multi-Agent Pipeline – Automated ML workflows that keep running even when individual components fail (yes, I tested failure modes exhaustively).

    ]
    }

## Why This Approach Works

Most people either build traditional software or use AI tools. I do both at the same time. I think in prompts while architecting systems, which lets me explore solutions that aren’t obvious through code alone.

The short timeline isn’t about being a genius – it’s about relentless curiosity, rapid iteration, and systematically turning weird AI behavior into production-ready workflows.
What I’m Good At

    Turning Chaos Into Systems: I thrive in ambiguity and build reliable infrastructure out of experimental ideas.

    Rapid Experimentation: My prototypes usually come together within hours, not weeks – because AI collaboration accelerates learning loops.

    Functional Prototypes: Everything I ship is demo-ready and robust enough for production scaling, not just a weekend hack.

    Learning Through Failure: My systems get stronger because I intentionally push them to failure and design for recovery.

## Currently Exploring

    Secure patterns for multi-agent prompt systems (harder than it sounds)

    Collaboration without collision: how AI agents coordinate without stepping on each other

    Self-improving systems that refactor their own prompts

    Bio-inspired resilience patterns for distributed AI networks

## Professional Stuff

What I’m Looking For: Roles where I can explore AI’s frontiers as my primary tool – prototyping, experimenting, and building solutions to problems that don’t have obvious answers.

Work Style: Autonomous, zero-gravity thinker who loves collaboration when solving hard problems. I build by doing, not by endlessly planning.

Available For: Opportunities that let me build, break, learn, and ship.
## Real Talk

I’m not a typical developer because I don’t develop in a typical way. I’m building the future of software engineering – where humans and AI collaborate as co-creators, not just tool and user.

Right now, I’m refactoring my repos for security and reliability – because systems should not only work under ideal conditions, but gracefully fail and recover in the real world.

If you’re building AI systems that need to work under pressure (not just impress in demos), let’s connect. Chaos is optional. Results aren’t.
