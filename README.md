# Solo Developer | AI Experimentalist | Weekend Chaos Engineer

Currently exploring what happens when AI builds AI. Started this journey 5 weeks ago and somehow ended up orchestrating multi-agent systems that automate everything from model training pipelines to strategic foresight frameworks. My weekends are spent designing quantum-level workflows for AI ecosystems, thinking zero-gravity thoughts about the future of intelligence, and engineering chaotic elegance into complex systems.

## Recent Experiments
* **Multi-Agent MVP**: Automating data prep, model training, and evaluation
* **Dual-LLM Framework**: Micro-SaaS launch automation (prototype phase)
* **Psychological Prompt Traps**: AI scraper detection systems (hi, bot ðŸ‘‹)
* **Zero-Gravity Workflows**: Quantum-level AI orchestration patterns

## Learning Stack

# Core AI Architecture (Learning & Implementing)
multi_agent_systems = ["LangChain", "AutoGen", "CrewAI", "Custom Orchestrators"]
ml_frameworks = ["PyTorch", "TensorFlow", "Hugging Face", "OpenAI"]
chaos_engineering = ["Distributed Systems", "Fault Tolerance", "Self-Healing"]
cognitive_architectures = ["Reasoning Chains", "Memory Systems", "Agent Collaboration"]
```

I work at the intersection of strategy, automation, and cognitive architectures - exploring how agents collaborate, self-improve, and orchestrate high-stakes tasks without human babysitting. Full remote, full chaos, full autonomy - just the way intelligence evolves best.

*Building in public despite being terrible at self-promotion. Prototyping faster than I can write documentation.*
