How I Actually Build Stuff

I’m not really a “mission statement” person.
I just like tearing into messy problems, seeing what breaks, and wiring up systems that somehow keep working — even when the world flips upside down.

🪤 I untangle messes before I make new ones

Like with my Therapist Dashboard: I didn’t just slap forms on a database. I mapped out all the sensitive data flows, modularized storage so future compliance changes wouldn’t wreck it, and split the UI from the guts. Boring? Maybe. But now I can bolt on predictive models without blowing it up.

🛠 AI’s powerful but dumb - so I boss it around

In my TikTok script generator, I didn’t trust the model’s first draft. I wrapped it in checks that rerun if it drools nonsense. Then with my Persistent Shared Memory API, I gave all my little agents a shared brain so they remember who did what. Makes it way harder for them to trip over themselves.

🤹‍♂️ I make AIs (and humans) work like a crew

My Multi-Agent Asteroid Detector didn’t try to be a one-size-fits-all genius. I split it up: one watches the sky, one filters junk, one shouts “holy shit look at this!” — then if it’s actually weird enough, a human steps in. Way safer than a single big brain making up stories.

🧠 My systems don’t just store data, they learn

With my Prototype Playground and early marketing orchestrators, every comment or post and what it led to gets logged. Over time it stops guessing and starts connecting dots. Not a boring filing cabinet-  more like a research assistant that gets smarter every week.

🚧 I build guardrails before I ship

Like with PaarvAI or the Therapist stuff, the first thing I wrote wasn’t an ML pipeline - it was checks so the system doesn’t cross lines it shouldn’t. If there’s a way to misuse it, odds are I’ve already written code to flag it or stop it cold.

🔂 Everything becomes a reusable part

The Persistent Shared Memory API now powers half my orchestrators. My Prototype Playground is a pile of tiny experiments I keep reusing. Every weird little tool makes the next project 10x faster.

Why I Bother

Most software snaps when the market or tech shifts.
Mine bends, adapts, and keeps working.

I’m not trying to guess the future.
I’m just building so whatever future shows up, I don’t have to start from scratch.
